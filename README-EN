# 🏨 Outsystem Project – Hotel Application

Project developed during a **DIO bootcamp** using the **OutSystems** platform, focusing on rapid web application development, visual data modeling, and UX best practices.

This repository contains the application module `.oml` files, as well as supporting images for the conceptual model and the user interface.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

Build a **hotel reservation management** application in OutSystems, practicing:

- Data modeling (conceptual and logical)
- Creation of responsive web interfaces
- Implementation of business flows (reservations, guests, rooms)
- Best practices for organizing OutSystems modules

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `Hotel.oml`  
  Initial test module of the hotel application in OutSystems.

- `HotelRafa.oml`  
  Final version of the module.

- `conceitual.png`  
  Conceptual domain diagram (Entities: Guest, Room, Reservation, etc.).

- `icone.png`  
  Icon used in the application (app/module branding).

---

## 🧱 Main Features (expected)

> Note: Depending on which module version you open, screen/entity names may differ, but the overall flow is similar.

- **Guest Management**
  - Create, edit, and list guests
  - View details of each guest

- **Room Management**
  - Register rooms (number, type, status)
  - Control room availability

- **Reservations**
  - Create reservations linking guest and room
  - Manage check-in and check-out dates
  - List and view existing reservations

- **Web Interface**
  - Responsive pages built using OutSystems UI patterns
  - Simple and intuitive navigation for the end user

---

## 🚀 How to Open the Project (OutSystems)

1. **Install/Access OutSystems Service Studio**
   - Log in to your OutSystems account.

2. **Import the module**
   - Open **Service Studio**
   - Go to: `File` → `Open` → `From File...`
   - Select the desired file:
     - `HotelRafa.oml`

3. **Publish and run**
   - Click **1-Click Publish**
   - After publishing, open the application in the browser using the link generated by OutSystems (or by clicking **Open in Browser** in Service Studio).

---

## 🧩 Requirements

- OutSystems account/environment (Personal, Cloud, or the environment provided by DIO)
- **OutSystems Service Studio** installed
- Internet access to publish and test the application

---

## 🗺️ Conceptual Model

The `conceitual.png` diagram represents the main domain entities, for example:

- `Guest` – customer personal data
- `Room` – number, type, capacity, status
- `Reservation` – link between Guest and Room, check-in/check-out dates

Use this diagram as a reference to understand the database design and screen logic.

- **App Type:** Web  
- **Concepts practiced:**
  - Data modeling
  - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Navigation between screens
  - OutSystems UI patterns
  - Module publishing and debugging
