# 🔴🟡 OutSystems Project – Pokémon Website with PokeAPI

Web application built with **OutSystems**, consuming the public **[PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)** to display and explore **Pokémon** data.  
The project showcases low-code development, REST API integration, and responsive web UI design.

This repository contains the `.oml` module file of the application.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Build a **Pokémon website** in OutSystems that consumes data from **PokeAPI**, focusing on:

- Consuming REST APIs (PokeAPI)
- Modeling data to structure API responses
- Creating responsive screens for Pokémon listing and details
- Implementing search, filters, and pagination
- Following best practices for OutSystems module structure

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `Pokemon Project.oml`  
  Main application module for the Pokémon project in OutSystems (screens, integrations, entities, logic).

> You need **OutSystems Service Studio** to open this project.

---

## 🧱 Main Features

- **Pokémon List**
  - Dynamic list of Pokémon loaded from PokeAPI
  - Pagination or incremental loading (by page/offset)
  - Display of basic information (name, number, image, types)

- **Pokémon Details**
  - Detail page for a selected Pokémon, including:
    - Types
    - Height, weight, stats
    - Images/sprites
  - Data retrieved in real time from PokeAPI

- **Search and Filters**
  - Search by Pokémon name or number
  - Optional filters by type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)

- **Responsive Web Interface**
  - Layout adapted for desktop and mobile
  - Uses OutSystems UI patterns for a smooth user experience

---

## 🌐 PokeAPI Integration

The project integrates with the public [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Typical endpoints used (example)

- `GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?offset={offset}&limit={limit}`  
  Fetches a paginated list of Pokémon.

- `GET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}`  
  Fetches detailed information for a specific Pokémon.

### Example of REST API configuration in OutSystems (pseudo-configuration)

```text
Base URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2

Method: GET
Endpoint: /pokemon
Inputs: offset (Query), limit (Query)
Outputs: Results list and next page URL
The exact configuration may vary depending on how you mapped the API and data structures in Service Studio.

🚀 How to Open and Run the Project (OutSystems)
Install/Access OutSystems Service Studio
Download Service Studio and log in with your OutSystems account.
Import the module
Open Service Studio
Go to: File → Open → From File...
Select:
Pokemon Project.oml
Check configuration (if needed)
Ensure the environment has internet access to call PokeAPI.
Adjust any timeout or proxy settings required by your infrastructure.
Publish and run
Click 1-Click Publish
After publishing, click Open in Browser or use the application URL generated by OutSystems.
🧩 Requirements
OutSystems account/environment (Personal, Cloud, or corporate)
OutSystems Service Studio installed
Internet access to consume PokeAPI
Modern web browser to access the site
🗺️ Conceptual Model (example)
A typical conceptual model for this project may include entities such as:

Pokemon – core Pokémon data (name, number, image, etc.)
PokemonType – Pokémon types (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
PokemonStat – stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)
The entities may be:

Temporary only (used to store API responses at screen level), or
Persistent (if you choose to cache Pokémon data in the OutSystems database).
